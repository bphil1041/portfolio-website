# Portfolio Website

This project is my first foray into web development. It's a portfolio site built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This website features four pages (home, about, work, and contact) with a NavBar that directs the user to each page. 


## Pages

- the Home page features intro text, an image of me, and a link to my GitHub profile.

- the About page features some basic information about me and an image of a bike with css color change animations.

- the Work page features cards that display information about my projects, organized using flexbox. 

- the Contact page features my contact information and a message submission form.
